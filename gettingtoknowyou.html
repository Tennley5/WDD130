        <p> Hello! My name is Hailey Gibson. My major is Software Engineering. I am 17 years old, but I will be turning 18 on October 16th. I am a freshman. This is my first semester here at BYU-I. I was born in Hawaii, but I only lived there for three months before my family moved to Utah. We lived there for 5 years until we moved to Texas. We stayed there for about a year and a half, then we moved to Rexburg, Idaho and we have stayed here for almsot 11 years now. I am currently single, and I'm not looking to be in a serious relationship anytime soon. </p>
